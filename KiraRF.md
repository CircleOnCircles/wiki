# Kira RF Improvement

While the Kira is RF FCC compliant, it may not behave the best in noisy environments.

If you experience [strange lighting and resets](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/aidc4r/new_kira_susceptible_to_rfi_keying_up_2way_radio/) in the presence of a close high frequency transmitter you may benefit from installing a ferrite choke.

## Ordering

3mm clip on suppressors are available many places:

The most common mix is 43 which is good for up to 300MHz.

However, mix 61 may be better if you can find it, as it is effective from 200-2000 MHz and is able to better block 400-500 MHz interference.

## Installation

### Steps:

1. Remove the upper plate from the Kira. 
 - Lift the ring off the Kira, lift from the back edge first and then the front edge. Metal rings are held on with magnets, while plastic rings are held on by snapping in. Both types should lift off fairly easily.

2. Once the ring is removed, lift the plate from the plastic clips.

3. Lift the front of the board to reveal the inside of the case. Be careful to not tug on the internal cable.

4. Clip your ferrite core around the red and black cables. The ferrite should be close to the main keyboard circuit board rather than the smaller circuit board with the USB Type C connector.

5. Lower the board back into the bottom housing and add the ring.
